The main EBS volume, where the operating system and active applications are stored, is always in use and is called "hot." It keeps data permanently.

The classification of an additional EBS volume as "hot," "warm," or "cold" depends on how often it's used. If it's used a lot, like for databases or applications, it's considered "hot." This classification depends on specific usage.

S3 is typically used for storing data that is rarely accessed, making it "cold" storage. Yes, it can store data permanently.
